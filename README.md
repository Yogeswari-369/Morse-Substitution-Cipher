# Morse-Substitution-Cipher


Morse Substitution Cipher is a process of transmitting text information as a series of dits and dahs. Here dits refer to dots and dahs refer to dash. 
And the implementation of a Morse Substitution Cipher will be done by using Python. 
It is a character encoding and decoding scheme. The algorithm is very simple. Every character in the English
language is substituted by a series of ‘dots’ and ‘dashes’ and vice versa. This system was designed to transmit message securely to long distance. By using this system
this will overcome the security problems.
